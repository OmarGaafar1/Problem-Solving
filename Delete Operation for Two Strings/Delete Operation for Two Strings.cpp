                A   2  .  .  .
                T   3  .  .  .

            @ i = 1 ,j = 1    (S & E) are not equal so +1 deletion is supposed to be made + min of (1,1) which gives 2

        @ i =1 , j =2    (E & E) are equal so no more deletion is required , We take the min number of deletion is made whice is 1 @(i-1)(j-1)

        And so on...
